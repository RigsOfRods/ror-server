                        Welcome to PDCurses

Contents
--------

This directory contains demonstration programs to show and test the 
capabilities of curses libraries. Some of them predate PDCurses, 
PCCurses or even PCurses/NCurses. Although some PDCurses-specific code 
has been added, all programs remain portable to other implementations 
(at a minimum, to NCurses).

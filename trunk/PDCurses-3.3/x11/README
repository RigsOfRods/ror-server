Contents
--------

This is a port of PDCurses for X11, aka XCurses.  It is designed to 
allow existing curses programs to be re-compiled with PDCurses, 
resulting in native X11 programs.


Distribution Status
-------------------

As of April 13, 2006, the files in this directory are released to the 
Public Domain, except for ScrollBox*, which are under essentially the 
MIT X License.


To be Done
----------

- have newterm() create a new X window

- provide a command line parsing function to enable X command line
  arguments to be parsed and stripped from the arguments passed back
  to the calling procedure.

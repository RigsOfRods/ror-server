DESCRIPTION

The Rigs of Rods Server is a game server for Rigs of Rods (http://www.rigsofrods.com/).
It is compabible with RoR clients version 0.33d, and any future client using the RORNET protocol version 2.0

INSTALLATION

To create buildystem:
1. get premmake: http://premake.sourceforge.net/download and save binary into project directory
2. run premake (for example, see premake --help):
 * for linux: premake --target gnu
 * for windows: premake --target vs2005

To compile: make
Then copy the "rorserver" binary wherever you like.

The Rigs of Rods Server depends on the pthread library to be installed on your system.
It also uses SocketW (http://www.digitalfanatics.org/cal/socketw/index.html).
For your convenience, we included the source package of SocketW r031026, as it is not often included in standard distributions.
You don't need to compile or install SocketW on your system, the makefile will take care of compiling and statically link the provided SocketW code.

USE

to start a server:
rorserver (-ip <public IP>) (-port <port>) (-name <server name>) (-terrain <terrain name>) (-maxclients <max number of clients>) (-debug) (-lan) (-inet)

Options are:
-lan
	Force LAN mode: will not try to connect to the central repository to register the server.
-inet
	Force Internet mode. Will fail if it can not register with the central repository.
-ip <public IP>
	The IP address to which the server can be joined. Optional in inet mode. Mandatory in lan mode.
-port <port>
	The port number used by the server. Any port is possible, traditionnally it is 12000 and upward.
	Example: -port 12000
-name <server name>
	The advertised name of the server. No spaces allowed.
	Example: -name Bobs_place
-terrain <terrain name>
	The terrain served by this server. Must be a valid RoR terrain name, without the .terrn extension.
	Example: -terrain nhelens
-maxclients <max number of clients>
	The maximum number of clients handled by this server. Values below 16 are preferable. See the bandwidth note below.
-debug
	Verbose output

Notes:
By default, if neither -lan nor -inet is used, the server will try to register to the repository and fail back to LAN mode in case it can not.

Bandwidth used by the server:
The RoR server uses large amounts of bandwidth. The general formula to compute bandwidth is :
-DOWNLOAD: maxclients*64kbit/s
-UPLOAD  : maxclients*(maxclients-1)*64kbit/s
That translates into:
-4 clients: 256kbit/s download, 768kbit/s upload <= will nearly saturate most ADSL links
-8 clients: 512kbit/s download, 3.5Mbit/s upload
-16 clients:  1Mbit/s download,  15Mbit/s upload
-32 clients:  2Mbit/s download,  64Mbit/s upload <= will nearly saturate a 100Mbit/s LAN!
	
BUGS
The server now is relatively stable. But it can crash or stop accepting new clients after very long periods of high business.
A security issue detected by Luigi Auriemma has been solved.

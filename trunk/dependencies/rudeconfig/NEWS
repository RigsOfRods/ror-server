Release 5.0.2-1 - Matthew Flood 2006-04-08

	** Changed package versioning: 
		now using the LIBRARY_VERSION - RELEASE_VERSION
		RELEASE_VERSION will be set to 1 for each new LIBRARY_VERSION
		
	** Rolled the package into binary and source RPMs

_______________________________________________________________________________
Version 3.2 - Matthew Flood 2005-06-02

	** The following instance method has been added, allowing you to discover the current
	   filepath of the config object.  The name 'getConfigFile' was chosen to pair up with the already
		existing method - setConfigFile(const char *filepath)  

			const char *getConfigFile();

_______________________________________________________________________________
Version 3.1 - Matthew Flood 2005-05-18

	** The following static methods have been added, allowing you to alter the 
		default behavior of config objects before they are created.
	
			static void Config::setDefaultConfigFile(const char *filepath);
			static const char *Config::getDefaultConfigFile();
			
			static void Config::setDefaultCommentCharacter(char c);
			static char Config::getDefaultCommentCharacter();
			static void Config::setDefaultDelimiter(char c);
			static char Config::getDefaultDelimiter();
			static void Config::setDefaultPreserveDeleted(bool shouldPreserve);
			static bool Config::getDefaultPreserveDeleted();
		

	** When the method [ void load(const char *filename) ] is invoked, the filename passed in
	as a parameter is now remembered - it becomes the default filename for the instance.  
	This means that [ bool save(void) ] will always save to the file that was load()'ed.  
	Previously, the only way to alter the default filename for an object was to 
	call [ void setConfigFile( const char* filepath ) ].

	** setStringValue() and getStringValue() are now deprecated.
		Use getValue() and setValue() instead.
